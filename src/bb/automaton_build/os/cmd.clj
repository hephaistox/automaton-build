(defn create-process
  "Starts the execution of the command `cmd` in directory `dir` and store command outputs in atoms respectively named in `:out-stream` and `:err-stream`.
  To save resources, if the stream is empty a pause of `delay` milliseconds is waited before checking again
  Only `max-out-lines` and `max-err-lines` are stored in the atoms, if `nil` no value is stored at all.

  It's a non blocking function, next step could be `still-running?`, `wait-for` or `kill`.

  Returns a `process` with:

   * `:cmd` the command, e.g. [\"ls\" \"-la\"]
   * `:cmd-str` the command as a string e.g. `ls -la`
   * `:dir` the directory as provided by the user, e.g. \"\"
   * `:status` is a value among `:wip`, `:didnt-start`, `:success`, `:failure`
   * `:adir` the expanded directory (useful for debug), e.g. \"/User/johndoe/hephaistox\"

   * If the command starts successfully, it returns also
      * `:status = :wip`
      * `:bb-proc` the babashka process, normally for internal use only
      * `out-stream` a fixed size queue of lines to print on out stream
      * `err-stream` a fixed size queue of lines to print on err stream
   * If not - most probably if directory or command does not exist - returns a `process` with
      * `status=:cmd-doesnt-exist`
      * and prints an error message

  `cant-start` is executed if the command execution can't start.
